Jonathan Bromley graduated in Physics from Oxford 
University, England, around the time vacuum tubes 
were starting to go out of fashion.  He taught 
physics, electronics and computing to high school 
and undergraduate students, and worked on image 
processing and industrial control systems in both 
academic and commercial environments.  

From 2001 to 2009 Jonathan developed and delivered
training in HDL design and verification, with
special focus on SystemVerilog.

In 2009 Jonathan joined international verification 
consultancy Verilab, where he helps clients to use
up-to-date verification methodologies including
UVM, eRM and formal methods on ASIC projects.

Jonathan remains active in IEEE SystemVerilog
standards development, and has presented papers
at various industry conferences.
